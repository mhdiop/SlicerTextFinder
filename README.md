# SlicerTextFinder

This tools is designed as a contribution to the [Slicer](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/) Internationalization project.

It helps translators to easily find the strings they have to translate in the [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/3d-slicer/) platform.

It's an improvement of the first released tool, the [Slicer Strings Finder](https://github.com/mhdiop/SlicerStringsFinder).
